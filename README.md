####Code review by Xingjian Bi:

I love your homepage design, there’s a high contrast between your background and your text 
allowing me to navigate to the text quickly. Your HTML and CSS files are very organized and readable. I also like your pages are mobile friendly, like your gallery can adjust picture sizes according to window size. 
For your images, I think it’s better to name it using ‘actual names’ like mountain, cat, cat01 rather than pure numbers. Also it’s better to have the navbar stick on top while browsing long contents . There’s some image missing in your gallery.  For the readme file, you forgot to link the class page to your readme. And webhomepage.png file should be in your image folder. 
Overall it’s a great website! I really love your color choices, it fits so much.
